# 2D-Convolution-with-Python
Convolution
Run network.py.
from console call predict() function in the network object.

Add new image kernels by calling the add_slice function in the convolution layer.
arguments-
height of target image
width of target image
kheight is height of kernel
kwidth is width kernel
kernel is the matrix you want to add.
example 3x3 edge detection-
[[ -1, -1, -1],[ -1, 8, -1],[ -1, -1, -1]]
